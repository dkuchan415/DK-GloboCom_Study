# GloboCom Case Study

Background:

A telecommunications company, Globo-Com, is concerned because the percentage of their customers who are leaving the company for another service provider (referred to as churn) is too high.  A new CEO has recently joined Globo-Com and has asked the various functions (i.e. Marketing, Finance, Sales, Product) for their evaluation on how best to decrease the churn rate, ultimately helping to drive growth in market share.  Below are the various options being pitched by each of the different functions.

## Your Task:

The CEO has asked for your help in evaluating these options.  Specifically, do you agree with any of these proposals?  Why or why not?  Are there any changes you would make to any proposals to make them more impactful?  Do you have any other ideas that Globo-Com should consider?  Data has been provided from a random sampling of 10% of the company’s customers last year.  Use this data to evaluate the proposals (below) and provide a recommendation to the CEO to accept, reject, or modify these proposals and any additional recommendations you think are necessary.

## Proposals:

1.	Finance believes that churn percentage is a misleading indicator because it assumes all customers are equal.  They think most of our churn is from low-value customers and therefore has little impact on revenue.  Instead of trying to reduce churn, Globo-Com should stop marketing spend in this low-value, high churn segment to increase profitability. 
2.	Marketing believes Globo-Com needs to focus on being competitive specifically with its biggest competitor, Average Joe’s Wireless.  Average Joe’s Wireless recently ran a large campaign advertising it’s new international plan.  Marketing recommends further developing Globo-Com’s option – expanding into more countries than Average Joe’s for only a slightly higher cost.
3.	Sales is requesting 10 additional heads be added to account management/customer service.  Each will make ~40K annual salary.  This added expense will be more than offset by the revenue this team saves the company by minimizing churn.
4.	Operations wants additional time and resources to build a model that identifies groups (or segments) of customers with similar behaviors.  They believe a predictive model could be produced to inform strategic customer relationship programs for mitigating churn.  They have done some prelim exploratory data analysis and have found some trends.
